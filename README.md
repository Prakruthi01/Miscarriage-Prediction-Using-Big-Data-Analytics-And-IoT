# Miscarriage-Prediction-Using-Big-Data-Analytics-And-IoT
The miscarriage prediction system is designed to enhance maternal healthcare by predicting the risk of miscarriage, a common and emotionally challenging event affecting up to 50% of pregnancies. By employing wearable sensors to monitor maternal health parameters such as temperature, pulse, and activity levels, and integrating IoT devices like the ESP 32 for efficient data collection and processing, the system provides timely insights for medical intervention and emotional support. The project utilizes data science techniques and predictive modeling to analyze data from diverse sources, including medical records and environmental data, ensuring continuous and real-time monitoring.

The methodology involves several key steps: data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, IoT integration, user interface design, and system integration and testing. Machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, and deep learning models are implemented and optimized for performance. The system undergoes thorough validation using various metrics and cross-validation techniques. Collaboration with healthcare professionals ensures the system's relevance and effectiveness, while rigorous testing guarantees functionality and reliability. Ultimately, the project aims to create a proactive and accurate predictive system that reduces the risk of miscarriage and improves outcomes for expectant mothers and their babies.
